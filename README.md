Research Question to Answer: Is there a relationship between the income levels of the 5 boroughs in NYC and Covid 19 cases/deaths.

Project Description/Outline: We’ll look at each borough’s number of Covid 19 cases and determine if there is a correlation with their income level.

Final Analysis

According to the data, we can determine that there is a possible correlation between median household income and COVID 19 cases. We see that the two hardest hit boroughs, Brooklyn and Queens, also make about $20,000 less than the two highest earning boroughs, Manhattan and Staten Island. The least impacted boroughs are also the two highest earners. We also noticed that the Bronx (50,044) had about three times more cases than Staten Island (14,657). Staten Island ($82,166) also earns a little more than twice that of the Bronx ($38,467). However, Staten Island’s case rate of 3,078.04 could be attributed to its age demographic. Its rate is still under the Bronx but just over Queens and Brooklyn. Taking population into account we can see that Staten Island and Manhattan are both below .20% when it comes to COVID 19 deaths over borough population.


This tells us that lower income households could be more likely to contract COVID 19. Using this information we can properly allocate the COVID 19 response to these boroughs. That only means that we can look at exterior variables like population density or borough age groups to draw a better conclusion as to why lower income boroughs have more cases. 

Running this research again in the future, we can include more variables such as age, sex, race, and other obtainable demographics. Population and proximity density have an effect on the ability to social distance which in turn could explain the rise in cases.
